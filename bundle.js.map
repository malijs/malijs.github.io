Using highland we could do something like:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">app.use(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'writeHellos'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">async</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">ctx</span>) </span>{\\n  ctx.res = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Promise</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">resolve, reject</span>) =&gt;</span> {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> stream = fs.createWriteStream(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'messages.txt'</span>)\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">let</span> succeeded = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">let</span> failed = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>\\n    ctx.res = highland(stream)\\n      .tap(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">message</span> =&gt;</span> {\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">try</span> {\\n          stream.write(<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">JSON</span>.stringify(message))\\n          succeeded++\\n        } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">catch</span> (e) {\\n          failed++\\n        }\\n      })\\n      .toCallback(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">err, result</span>) =&gt;</span> {\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span>(err) reject(err)\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">else</span> resolve({ succeeded, failed })\\n      })\\n  })\\n})\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Note that since this is an asynchronous operation we must return a <code>Promise</code> that\\nis fulfilled only once we’re done with all the values emitted from the input stream.</p>\\n<h4>DUPLEX</h4>\\n<p>Finally, in case of <code>DUPLEX</code> call, the <code>ctx.req</code>, and <code>ctx.res</code> properties just\\nreference the gRPC <code>call</code> duplex stream.

Even if your middleware accepts <em>no</em> options, this is still\\na good idea to keep things uniform.</p>\\n<p>Here our contrived <code>logger</code> middleware accepts a <code>format</code> string for customization,\\nand returns the middleware itself:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">logger</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">format</span>) </span>{\\n  format = format || <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">':name [:type]'</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">async</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">ctx, next</span>) </span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> str = format\\n      .replace(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">':name'</span>, ctx.name)\\n      .replace(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">':type'</span>, ctx.type)\\n\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(str)\\n\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">await</span> next()\\n  }\\n}\\n\\napp.use(logger())\\napp.use(logger(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">':name | :type'</span>))\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4>Named middleware</h4>\\n<p>Naming middleware is optional, however it’s useful for debugging purposes to assign a name.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">logger</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">format</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">async</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">logger</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">ctx, next</span>) </span>{\\n\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4>Response Middleware</h4>\\n<p>Middleware that decide to respond to a request and wish to bypass downstream middleware may\\nsimply omit <code>next()</code>. Typically this will be in routing middleware, but this can be performed by\\nany. For example the following will respond with “two”, however all three are executed, giving the\\ndownstream “three” middleware a chance to manipulate the response.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">async</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">fn1</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">ctx, next</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&gt;&gt;

Typically these\\nfunctions do not return anything, and we ignore their return values.</p>\\n<h4>UNARY</h4>\\n<p>Unary calls are the simplest. They are simple request and response remote procedure\\ncalls. The client calls the remote method with certain request message and the service\\nresponds with a response message. In case of <code>UNARY</code> calls simply set <code>ctx.res</code> to\\nthe response message value.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">app.use(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">ctx</span> =&gt;</span> ctx.res = { <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">message</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'Hello '</span> + ctx.req.name })\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In most cases we would do some kind of actual work within a handler that may involve\\nperforming asynchronous actions. Mali expects and supports <code>Promise</code> implementation\\nin such scenarios. Using <a href=\\\"https://babeljs.io/\\\">Babel</a> or <a href=\\\"https://github.com/leebyron/async-to-gen\\\">async-to-gen</a>\\nwe can take advantage of <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> ES6 mechanisms to make such code\\ncleaner and more intuitive.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">async</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">getUser</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">ctx</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// read user from database based on user id and send it once done</span>\\n  ctx.res = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">await</span> ctx.db.get(ctx.req.id)\\n}\\n\\napp.use({ getUser })\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4>RESPONSE STREAM</h4>\\n<p>Another type of call is where clients call a remote with a request message and\\nexpect a stream in response that emits the message values. This is typically useful\\nfor getting list of things based on some parameters.</p>\\n<p>For example lets say we have a JSON file, <code>messages.json</code>:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-json\\\">[\\n  {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">\\\"message\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Hello Bob\\\"</span>\\n  },\\n  {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">\\\"message\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Hello Kate\\\"</span>\\n  },\\n  {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">\\\"message\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Hello Jim\\\"</span>\\n  },\\n  {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">\\\"message\\\"</span>: <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"Hello Sara\\\"</span>\\n  }\\n]\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>If we have a call definition <code>sayHellos</code> that expects a stream of message,\\nwe could stream this to the client using\\n<a href=\\\"https://github.com/dominictarr/JSONStream\\\"><code>JSONStream</code></a> module:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">app.use(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'sayHellos'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">ctx</span>) </span>{\\n  ctx.res = fs\\n    .createReadStream(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'messages.json'</span>)\\n    .pipe(JSONStream.parse(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'*'</span>))\\n})\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Another useful module for working with streams is <a href=\\\"http://highlandjs.org\\\">Highland.js</a>.</p>\\n<h4>REQUEST STREAM</h4>\\n<p>Similarly with a <code>REQEUST STREAM</code> call a client calls the remote with a stream of\\ninput message values and expects a single response based on the inputs.</p>\\n<p>For example if the client sent a stream of messages it might want to know the number\\nsuccessfully written and failed. Using highland we could do something like:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">app.use(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'writeHellos'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">async</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">ctx</span>) </span>{\\n  ctx.res = <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">new</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">Promise</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">resolve, reject</span>) =&gt;</span> {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> stream = fs.createWriteStream(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'messages.txt'</span>)\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">let</span> succeeded = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">let</span> failed = <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>\\n    ctx.res = highland(stream)\\n      .tap(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">message</span> =&gt;</span> {\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">try</span> {\\n          stream.write(<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">JSON</span>.stringify(message))\\n          succeeded++\\n        } <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">catch</span> (e) {\\n          failed++\\n        }\\n      })\\n      .toCallback(<span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\">(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">err, result</span>) =&gt;</span> {\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span>(err) reject(err)\\n        <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">else</span> resolve({ succeeded, failed })\\n      })\\n  })\\n})\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Note that since this is an asynchronous operation we must return a <code>Promise</code> that\\nis fulfilled only once we’re done with all the values emitted from the input stream.</p>\\n<h4>DUPLEX</h4>\\n<p>Finally, in case of <code>DUPLEX</code> call, the <code>ctx.req</code>, and <code>ctx.res</code> properties just\\nreference the gRPC <code>call</code> duplex stream. We implement this the same as we would\\nwith the stock <code>grpc</code> module, just read the data coming in using <code>data</code> events\\non the <code>ctx.req</code> property and and write the data to the client using the <code>write</code>\\nmethod of <code>ctx.res</code>.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\">app.use(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'processStuff'</span>, <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">async</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">processStuff</span> (<span

Even if your middleware accepts <em>no</em> options, this is still\\na good idea to keep things uniform.</p>\\n<p>Here our contrived <code>logger</code> middleware accepts a <code>format</code> string for customization,\\nand returns the middleware itself:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">logger</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">format</span>) </span>{\\n  format = format || <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">':name [:type]'</span>\\n\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">async</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">ctx, next</span>) </span>{\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">const</span> str = format\\n      .replace(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">':name'</span>, ctx.name)\\n      .replace(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">':type'</span>, ctx.type)\\n\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(str)\\n\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">await</span> next()\\n  }\\n}\\n\\napp.use(logger())\\napp.use(logger(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">':name | :type'</span>))\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4>Named middleware</h4>\\n<p>Naming middleware is optional, however it’s useful for debugging purposes to assign a name.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">logger</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">format</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">async</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">logger</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">ctx, next</span>) </span>{\\n\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4>Response Middleware</h4>\\n<p>Middleware that decide to respond to a request and wish to bypass downstream middleware may\\nsimply omit <code>next()</code>. Typically this will be in routing middleware, but this can be performed by\\nany. For example the following will respond with “two”, however all three are executed, giving the\\ndownstream “three” middleware a chance to manipulate the response.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-js\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">async</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-function\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">function</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">fn1</span> (<span class=\\\"hljs-params\\\">ctx, next</span>) </span>{\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">console</span>.log(<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'&gt;&gt;
